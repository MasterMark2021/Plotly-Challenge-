Plotly and JavaScript Workings

**Purpose**
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive dashboard that visualizes the bacterial data for each volunteer.

**Resources**
Data Sources: BellyButton_bar_chart_starter_code.js, BellyButton_bubble_chart_starter_code.js, BellyButton_bubble_chart_starter_code.js

**Code Files:** charts.js, index.html, style.css, 

Software: Visual Studio Code, ES6, D3, Javascript, HTML, CSS.

**Result**

The dashboard is interactive with a dropdown menu and the ability to hover over data points in graphs to learn more information. For example, in the bubble graph below, hovering over individual bubbles will show more details about the bacteria cultures. Selecting a new Test Subject ID No. from the menu will result in a quick change of all of the graphs and print new Demographic Information.
